Goal for this project: 


Make seamlessly bi-directional communicating real-time system, for Remote Control and Robotics applications (Example: RC car and remote), with the least possible latency while still providing room for lots of "channels".


Features:

Driver for Si4463 [WORKING]: The radio IC this project is based around, but not limited to.

Simple Acknowledged Packets with Id [WORKING]: carrying only the original packet's header and optional id. Currently only used for establishing a link, as the Ack packets ignore the collision-avoidance setup. This way we can accuratelly measure total system latency before the link is ready.

Synchronized clock [WORKING]: when establishing a link, the Remote's clock is synced to the Host's clock. The host clock is randomized for each new link session. The clock is tuned during link time (TODO: Improve).

Packet collision avoidance [WORKING]: with the Synchronized clock, we split a fixed period in half where the Host can only transmit during the first half and the Remote during the second half (half-duplex). Default duplex period is 10 milliseconds.

Unbuffered Output [WORKING]: Each LoLa service can handle a packet send being delayed or even failed, so we don't need to buffer outputs. IPacketSendService extends the base ILoLaService and provides overloads for extension.

Link Handshake Handling [WORKING] â€“ Broadcast, send challenge response and start session. Clock is synced and Crypto tokens are exchanged.

Link management [WORKING]: Link service establishes a link and fires events when the link is gained or lost. Keeps sending pings (with replies) to make sure the partner is still there, avoiding stealing bandwidth from user services.

Message Authentication Code [WORKING]: The base seed of the MAC defaults at 0 and is set to a deterministic value at linking time (based on the host and remote's id and link session id). During link time however, it is generated on a Time-based One-time Password (TOTP).
A TOTP seed is exchanged on link, which is then used to generate a token for each message. The decoding side uses the same TOTP token. The output space is only 8 bits, to optimize bandwidth. To compensate for this, the time base is around 100 milliseconds, which is much shorter than the time it takes to try all 256 possibilities. A typical transation takes around ~4 milliseconds, end-to-end, so an attacker would have at best ~25 attempts before the token switched, which would yeld a low success rate.
This project makes no claims of cryptographic security and provides the cryptographic features only for functionality purposes, such as rejecting unauthorized access and implicit addressing. Transmitted data quality is already "assured" by the Radio IC's 16 bit CRC.

SyncSurface Service [WORKING]: The star feature and whole reason I started this project. Synchronises an array of N blocks (32bits wide) in a differential fashion, i.e., only send over radio the changing blocks, not the whole data array. There's a 2-way protocol to ensure data integrity without compromising data update latency.

Link diagnostics [WORKING BARE]: Measures link properties: Latency, TODO: add more.


Why not Radiohead or similar radio libraries? 

I'd like to build a real time system, biasing the implementation for low latency and code readability. Besides, it's fun. 

 

Gist of the inner working: 

The packet driver is a specialized packet handler: when receiving, it tries to throw the incoming packet to one of the registered LoLa Services. There is no callback for when no registered service wants the packet. 

The packets definitions and payload are defined in a very minimalistic way with only some configurability.
  

Notable issues: 

It's quite a memory hog (around 1.5 kB for the example projects with only 2 sync surfaces), and ROM but there's a lot of functionality. 

 


Future : 

Improved Time Source: current version is working but should be considered a fallback. GPS based time sources or an external time keeping device should be preferred.

Piggyback Latency Measurement: There's a lot of Ack'ed packets being exchanged when linking. We can track those and measure the system latency before the link is even up.

Channel hoping: The Host should hop on various channels while broadcasting, as should the remote while trying to establish a link. During link time, we can use the same time-base mechanism of the TOTP to generate a pseudo-random channel hopping. Maybe include a white-list of usable channels, which could itself be self-updating.

Some bugs with:
